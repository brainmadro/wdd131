            <h2>In the beginning...</h2>
            <p>It's an afternoon in early 2013. Larry Page leans back in the wide leather seat have a private jet. He absent mindedly smooths his salt and pepper bags against his forehead as he skims emails on his phone.<br/>
                Back in 1998, Paige co founded Google. What started as a search engine is now one of the biggest tech companies in the world, trafficking and email video sharing cloud storage and more. As CEO, Paige is on a mission to keep growing the behemoth and he's always on the lookout for the next world changing technology.
                In a seat near page, Elon Musk cracks open a Diet Coke.

            <p>In the early 2000s, Musk was involved with PayPal the E payment system. Now he runs Tesla, the electric car company, as well as SpaceX which builds space rockets page and musk are good friends and when the scheduling works out, but hitch rides on each other's jet. Along with him today is Luke Nosek co founder of PayPal.
                Nosek computer beeps with the sound of a new email coming in. Nosek clicks it open. Moments later, the beeps and boops of an old school video game omit from his laptop speakers. Nosek eyes go wide as he watches.<br/>
                <br/>---- Hey, Elon, did you get this email from Demis at DeepMind, Musk and Nosek recently invested in artificial intelligence company called Deep Mind based in London.<br/>---- Yeah, but I haven't opened it yet.<br/>---- You, gotta this feels like true artificial intelligence<br/><br/>Page puts down his bone is interest piqued. Along with other big tech companies. Google has been pursuing developing artificial intelligence for the past few years, but it's been relatively slow going.<br/><br/>---- I want to see, Musk angles his laptop screen so Paige can watch with him.<br/><br/>He clicks on the link, the video starts.
                It begins with the opening screen of the video game breakout created by Atari in the 1970s. In it, a player controls a rectangular paddle at the bottom of the screen and tries to bounce a ball into rows of rainbow colored bricks at the top. The goal is to clear all of the bricks from the screen. If the paddle misses the ball too many times the player loses,
                the game starts to play. At first, the player controlling the paddle is unskilled, unable to even hit the ball most of the time. But over the course of the video, the player gets good. Really good.<br/><br/>By the end, the player has figured out how to get the ball behind the bricks where the ball bounces between the upper wall and the bricks, clearing them quickly without ever risking the ball passing the paddle at the bottom.
                As the video ends page looks up at Musk and Nosek,<br/><br/>---- Let me be sure I understand the player is a computer and it wasn't programmed to know how to play the game. Nosek nods.<br/>---- All they told him was to maximize the number of points that achieved it figured out the rest on its own, Page look stunned.<br/>---- In two hours, he came up with its own strategy, and by the end it played better than any human ever has. Just incredible.<br/>Musk shifts in his seat.<br/>---- Incredible and terrifying. Today, it's beating a video game. Tomorrow it's operating power plants and making military decisions.
                <br/>But at this moment, Paige isn't thinking about the downsides of AI. All he's thinking about is that this technology should belong to Google.<br/>---- What do you say the company that developed this was called Deep Mind.
                <br/><br/>Soon, Google won't be the only company interested in acquiring Deep Mind. And deep mind won't be the only leader in the field.
                The major tech companies are about to enter a race to develop the most superior artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. And potentially change society forever.
