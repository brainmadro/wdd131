            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, natural language processing, and the ability to adapt to new contexts.

            <h2>History of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                The concept of intelligent machines has fascinated humanity since ancient times, but it was in the 20th century that AI began to take shape as a scientific field. In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference, considered the formal starting point of AI as a discipline, was held. Since then, the field has experienced multiple phases of optimism and skepticism, known as the "summers" and "winters" of AI.

            <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                AI has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, development of personalized treatments, medical image analysis.</li>
                <li>Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk management.</li>
                <li>Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization, intelligent traffic systems.</li>
                <li>Education: Intelligent tutors, personalized learning, student performance analysis.</li>
                <li>Entertainment: Recommendation engines, content creation, video games.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                As AI continues to advance, challenges and ethical considerations also arise. Some of the main challenges include data privacy and security, algorithm transparency and explainability, bias and fairness in AI systems, and the impact on employment and the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial that AI development is conducted responsibly and ethically, ensuring that benefits are distributed equitably and risks are minimized.
